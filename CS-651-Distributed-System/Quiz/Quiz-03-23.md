So far, we have seen the following approaches to reliable data replication:

 

1. Paxos-based protocols, such as Raft.


2. Primary-Backup replication protocols, as those used in FaRM.

 

3. Pub/Sub-based replication, as in PNUTS.

 

Distributed consensus protocols that are based on majorities require 2f+1 servers to tolerate f failures. On the other hand, Primary-Backup replication schemes only need f+1 servers. This difference was also outlined in the FaRM paper (cf. end of Section 4).

 

Given that Primary-Backup replication achieves the same result with fewer servers, and majority-based consensus algorithms are also harder to implement in practice, then why bothering with Paxos-based schemes in the first place?

 

What about using Raft or a Primary-Backup based approach for replicating data across regions in PNUTS? Would that be a viable solution in your opinion?
