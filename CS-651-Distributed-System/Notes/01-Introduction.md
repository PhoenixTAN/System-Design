# Introduction

## What is a distributed system?
- multiple cooperating computers
- DNS, P2P file sharing, big databases, MapReduce, &c
- lots of critical infrastructure is distributed!

## Why distribute?
- to connect physically separate entities
- to achieve security via isolation
- to tolerate faults via replication
- to scale up throughput via parallel CPUs/mem/disk/net
  
### But
- complex: many concurrent parts
- must cope with partial failure
- tricky to realize performance potential

## Why take this course?
- interesting -- hard problems, non-obvious solutions
- used by real systems -- driven by the rise of big Web sites
- active research area -- lots of progress + big unsolved 
- hands-on -- you'll build serious systems in the labs
